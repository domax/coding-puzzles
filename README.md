coding-puzzles
==============

Some coding sessions and puzzles I've got in interviews. Now I use JDK 17.

One of specifics of Java classes here is that I'm trying to keep them as simple as possible and use
_only_ JDK built-in features - no additional libraries.

Plus all the classes may be launched as standalone runnable, like:

```shell
cd ./src
java GrossToNet.java
```
